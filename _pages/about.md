I’m a Ph.D. student at Jožef Stefan International Postgraduate School. My academic interests lie primarily in machine learning and data science, but I also enjoy mathematics and computer science. I mostly work on graph learning, representation learning, equation discovery, geometric deep learning, and interpretable machine learning.

I come from Piran, where I finished elementary school (OŠ Cirila Kosmača Piran) and high school (Srednja tehnična šola Koper). I got my bachelor’s degree in mathematics and computer science from the Faculty of Computer and Information Science in Ljubljana and my master’s degree from the same field at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics in Ljubljana.

In my free time, I like to watch and play sports, mostly volleyball and football (soccer). My biggest achievement in volleyball is the title of national under-18 champions with GO Volley in the 2013/14 season. I also like reading, especially epic fantasy (for example the cosmere universe).

If you want to enquire about my work, a collaboration, or to talk about mutual interests feel free to contact me through email.
