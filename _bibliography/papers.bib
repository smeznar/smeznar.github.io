  abstract={Learning from complex real-life networks is a lively research area, with recent advances in learning information-rich, low-dimensional network node representations. However, state-of-the-art methods are not necessarily interpretable and are therefore not fully applicable to sensitive settings in biomedical or user profiling tasks, where explicit bias detection is highly relevant. The proposed SNoRe (Symbolic Node Representations) algorithm is capable of learning symbolic, human-understandable representations of individual network nodes, based on the similarity of neighborhood hashes which serve as features. SNoRe's interpretable features are suitable for direct explanation of individual predictions, which we demonstrate by coupling it with the widely used instance explanation tool SHAP to obtain nomograms representing the relevance of individual features for a given classification. To our knowledge, this is one of the first such attempts in a structural node embedding setting. In the experimental evaluation on eleven real-life datasets, SNoRe proved to be competitive to strong baselines, such as variational graph autoencoders, node2vec and LINE. The vectorized implementation of SNoRe scales to large networks, making it suitable for contemporary network learning and analysis tasks.},

  abstract="Understanding how information propagates in real-life complex networks yields a better understanding of dynamical processes such as misinformation or epidemic spreading. With the recent resurgence of graph neural networks as a powerful predictive methodology, many network properties can be studied in terms of their predictability and as such offer a novel view on the studied process, with the direct application of fast predictions that are complementary to resource-intensive simulations. We investigated whether graph neural networks can be used to predict the effect of an epidemic, should it start from a given individual (patient zero). We reformulate this problem as node regression and demonstrate the high utility of network-based machine learning for a better understanding of the spreading effects. By being able to predict the effect of a given individual being the patient zero, the proposed approach offers potentially orders of magnitude faster risk assessment and potentially aids the adopted epidemic spreading analysis techniques.",

  abstract={The competition "Predicting Generalization in Deep Learning (PGDL)" aims to provide a platform for rigorous study of generalization of deep learning models and offer insight into the progress of understanding and explaining these models. This report presents the solution that was submitted by the user \emph{smeznar} which achieved the eight place in the competition. In the proposed approach, we create simple metrics and find their best combination with automatic testing on the provided dataset, exploring how combinations of various properties of the input neural network architectures can be used for the prediction of their generalization.},

  abstract="Understanding how information propagates in real-life complex networks yields a better understanding of dynamic processes such as misinformation or epidemic spreading. The recently introduced branch of machine learning methods for learning node representations offers many novel applications, one of them being the task of spreading prediction addressed in this paper. We explore the utility of the state-of-the-art node representation learners when used to assess the effects of spreading from a given node, estimated via extensive simulations. Further, as many real-life networks are topologically similar, we systematically investigate whether the learned models generalize to previously unseen networks, showing that in some cases very good model transfer can be obtained. This paper is one of the first to explore transferability of the learned representations for the task of node regression; we show there exist pairs of networks with similar structure between which the trained models can be transferred (zero-shot) and demonstrate their competitive performance. To our knowledge, this is one of the first attempts to evaluate the utility of zero-shot transfer for the task of node regression.",

  abstract={The increasing amounts of semantic resources offer valuable storage of human knowledge; however, the probability of wrong entries increases with the increased size. The development of approaches that identify potentially spurious parts of a given knowledge base is thus becoming an increasingly important area of interest. In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of whether structure-only link analysis methods can already offer a scalable means to detecting possible anomalies, as well as potentially interesting novel relation candidates. Evaluating thirteen methods on eight different semantic resources, including Gene Ontology, Food Ontology, Marine Ontology and similar, we demonstrated that structure-only link analysis could offer scalable anomaly detection for a subset of the data sets. Further, we demonstrated that by considering symbolic node embedding, explanations of the predictions (links) could be obtained, making this branch of methods potentially more valuable than the black-box only ones. To our knowledge, this is currently one of the most extensive systematic studies of the applicability of different types of link analysis methods across semantic resources from different domains. },
